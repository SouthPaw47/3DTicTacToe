# 3D Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a Python implementation of a 3D Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3x3 grid. The objective is to get three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal across any of the three grids.

## How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` file to start the game.
2. Enter the name of the two players when prompted.
3. Each player takes turns specifying their move by entering the grid number, row, and column of the square they want to mark.
4. The game continues until one player wins or it's a tie.
5. After each game, the scores of the players are displayed, and you're given the option to play again.

## Game Features

- Random selection of the starting player.
- Detection of wins and ties in all dimensions of the 3D game board.
- Scores are kept track of for multiple rounds.
